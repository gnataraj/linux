The `source` command in Linux is used to execute commands from a file in the current shell session. It is particularly useful when you want to apply changes to the current shell environment, such as updating environment variables or defining functions, without launching a new shell.

When you run a script or execute commands in a shell, they typically run in a subshell. Any changes made to the environment, such as setting environment variables, are only applied to that subshell and do not affect the parent shell. The `source` command (or its equivalent `.`) allows you to run commands from a file in the current shell, ensuring that any changes persist in the current session.

For example, if you have a script named `myscript.sh` that sets environment variables, you can use the `source` command to apply those changes to your current shell:

```bash
source myscript.sh
```

This is particularly useful in scenarios like modifying the `PATH` variable or defining shell functions that you want to use immediately in the current session.

Keep in mind that if you run a script without using `source` (or `.`), a new subshell is created to execute the script, and any environment changes made within the script won't affect the parent shell.
